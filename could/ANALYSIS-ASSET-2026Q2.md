**POST /recipes/generate request flow:**
1. `requireAuth` (JWT verify) → `recipeGenerateRateLimit` (Redis INCR)
2. `prisma.user.findUnique` (role, recipeStyle, continentPreferences) + `prisma.recipe.findMany` (last 20 titles)
3. Build prompt → send to Ollama (serial queue) or Claude (30s timeout)
4. On Claude failure → fallback to Ollama
5. `pluralStem` pantry matching on recipe ingredients
6. In parallel: `findRecipeVideo(title)` + `generateOgImage(emoji)` (Twemoji CDN fetch)
7. `appendMetric(...)` → recipe-metrics.csv
8. Return JSON

**External dependencies:**
- `https://appleid.apple.com/auth/keys` — Apple JWKS (per Apple auth request, no cache)
- `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twemoji/14.0.2/72x72/*.png` — emoji PNGs (cached in-process)
- `GOOGLE_CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL` — operational alerts
- YouTube Data API — `src/services/youtube.ts`
- Gmail SMTP — `GMAIL_USER` / `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`
- `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` — Claude (when `AI_PROVIDER=claude` or `provider=claude`)

**Active data models:** User, Recipe, RecipeReview, SavedList, SavedListItem, DietaryPreference, PantryItem, Flow, FlowStep, UserFlowView, PasswordResetToken, EmailVerificationToken
## ASSET:analysis 2026-06-19 16:05 → Flow system is cleanly extensible with typed step enum and per-user completion tracking; admin guard is DB-confirmed not JWT-claimed

Two well-designed structural patterns: (1) The `Flow` + `FlowStep` + `UserFlowView` system in the Prisma schema provides a content-addressable onboarding framework: steps are ordered integers with a `FlowStepType` enum (`preferences | tip`), flows have `trigger` (`first_login | manual`), `priority`, `adminOnly`, and `isActive` flags. `UserFlowView` records per-user completion with `skippedSteps`, `responses`, and `completedAt`. Adding a new step type (e.g., `rating`) requires only extending the enum and the response handler in `src/routes/flows.ts`. (2) `requireAdmin` middleware in `src/routes/admin.ts` calls `prisma.user.findUnique({ select: { role: true } })` at request time rather than reading the role from the JWT payload. This means a role downgrade takes effect immediately without requiring token re-issue — correct for an admin escalation model where the JWT's 7-day lifetime is too long to trust for role claims.
## ASSET:analysis 2026-06-19 14:28 → Three-context architecture cleanly separates session, server data, and error state; registerUnauthenticatedHandler decouples API from React lifecycle

Context separation is correct: `AuthContext` owns only JWT token + user identity + tab-bar visibility, `UserDataContext` owns server-fetched preferences and usage data, `AppStateContext` owns the error overlay — no context is responsible for two unrelated domains. The `registerUnauthenticatedHandler` pattern in `src/services/api.ts` keeps the axios instance framework-agnostic while still routing 401 events into React state: the API module doesn't import React or reference any hook, making it independently testable. `pantryMatch.ts` exports named pure functions (`computeMatchStats`, `pantryMatch`, `ingredientContains`) with no side effects and typed interfaces, making it the strongest candidate for unit tests in the codebase.
## ASSET:analysis 2026-06-15 09:12 → AIProvider interface, discover SQL query, and extractFoodEmoji pipeline are well-abstracted and production-ready

Three strong structural patterns: (1) `src/services/ai/index.ts` exposes `getAIProvider()` — a clean factory that switches between `OllamaProvider`, `ClaudeProvider`, and `OpenAIProvider` via `AI_PROVIDER` env var. All providers implement the `AIProvider` interface with a single `generateRecipe()` method, making future provider addition a contained change. (2) `GET /recipes/discover` uses a single raw SQL query with LATERAL join to compute pantry match counts and grocery percentages in one DB round-trip — correct and efficient, avoiding N+1 fetch patterns. (3) `extractFoodEmoji()` implements a deterministic four-stage pipeline: AI emoji gate → title keyword inference → ingredient inference → hardcoded fallback. Each stage has a clear fallthrough contract. The `FOOD_DRINK_SET` gate intentionally excludes dishware and drink emojis, which is documented inline.
## ASSET:analysis 2026-06-14 23:03 → metric columns available for cross-provider recipe quality analysis

From `logs/recipe-metrics.csv`:
- **Provider**: `requestedProvider`, `usedProvider`, `fallback`
- **Quality**: `pantryPct` (selected items used / selected items), `groceryPct` (pantry items / total ingredients), `steps`, `ingredientCount`
- **Performance**: `responseMs`
- **Context**: `style` (classic/creative), `filters`, `continent`, `promptVersion`

From `logs/discover-metrics.csv`:
- `avgPantryPct`, `avgGroceryPct` across discover feed results per user session

Note: `groceryPct` in metrics CSV is currently miscalculated (see BUG-ISSUE-2026Q2) — cross-provider analysis should use `pantryPct` as the reliable signal until the bug is fixed.
## ASSET:analysis 2026-06-13 18:11 → Clean AIProvider abstraction, atomic Redis patterns, and production-grade auth flows

The `AIProvider` interface with three concrete implementations (Ollama, OpenAI, Claude) behind a factory function is a clean extension point — adding a new provider requires only a new class and a factory switch case. The Redis Lua INCR+EXPIRE script is a production-correct atomic concurrency pattern. `pluralStem` + `stemMatch` in `cookRecords.ts` handles 15 irregular plurals (leaf/leaves, knife/knives, etc.) with an explicit invariant table. Apple Sign In uses native Node.js `crypto.createPublicKey({ format: 'jwk' })` without extra dependencies. The `@@unique([userId, flowId])` constraint on `UserFlowView` prevents duplicate flow records at the DB layer regardless of concurrent requests.
## ASSET:analysis 2026-06-13 17:04 → Discover SQL, insight thresholds, and continent pool

**Discover SQL entry point:** `src/routes/recipes.ts:645-696`
- Filter: `shareToken IS NOT NULL`, `userId != requester`, `groceryPct >= 20`
- Order: `matchCount DESC, createdAt DESC` — LIMIT 20
- Includes: avgStars, reviewCount, myStars, author profileVisibility
- Pantry match is computed via `UNNEST(r.pantryUsed)` cross-referenced against the requesting user's `PantryItem` table

**Insight analysis thresholds** (`src/services/ai/insights.ts`):
| Category | Threshold | Min data |
|---|---|---|
| dietary | ≥30% of last 50 recipes match tag not in prefs | 5 recipes |
| cuisine | ≥40% of continent-tagged recipes from one continent | 3 with continent |
| style | ≥70% of styled recipes use one style ≠ current | 10 recipes, 5 with style |
| pantry | ingredient in ≥25% of recipes, not in pantry | 5 recipes |
| mealType | one type ≥50% of typed recipes | 4 with mealType |

**Continent pool:** `src/services/ai/provider.ts:383-450` — 71 [country, continent] pairs across 7 continents

**Ollama does not filter by continentPreferences:** `src/services/ai/ollama.ts:190` — `pickRegion()` called with no args
## ASSET:analysis 2026-06-09 18:16 â†’ Express middleware stack is minimal and explicit; no framework magic; Prisma-generated types make DB schema the single source of truth; ownership-guard pattern is applied uniformly across all mutable routes

**Explicit, readable middleware stack:**
- The Express middleware chain in `src/index.ts` is short and explicit: CORS â†’ JSON body parser â†’ request logger â†’ routes. There is no hidden middleware injected by a framework, no auto-discovery, no decorator-based registration. Any developer reading `src/index.ts` top-to-bottom sees exactly what executes on every request, in order. This makes debugging request-level issues straightforward.

**Prisma schema as single source of truth:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` is the authoritative definition of the data model. Prisma-generated TypeScript types flow into all route handlers via `@prisma/client` â€” there is no separate model layer, no manual type-to-table mapping, and no ORM configuration file. Adding a column to the schema automatically makes it available and typed throughout the application after `prisma generate`. The data model and the types are structurally in sync by construction.

**Uniform ownership-guard pattern:**
- Every route that mutates user-owned data (`recipes`, `lists`, `pantry`, `records`, `insights`) uses the same `{ id, userId: req.userId! }` where-clause pattern. The consistency of this pattern means ownership enforcement is auditable by grep: any route that queries by id alone is immediately identifiable as a potential IDOR risk. This regularity is a meaningful security asset â€” it is not accidental.

## ASSET:analysis 2026-06-09 18:03 â†’ Codebase is ~2000 LOC across ~20 files; TypeScript strict typing throughout; domain-aligned route structure; operational tooling (pm2, Slack, Redis, health) production-ready for current scale

**Codebase size and shape:**
- ~2,000 lines of TypeScript across ~20 source files â€” small enough for any developer to hold the full architecture in context, with no hidden complexity in deep dependency trees
- Routes are domain-aligned (one file per entity: recipes, users, auth, pantry, lists, records, insights, flows, admin, chat) â€” finding the handler for any endpoint is predictable
- No over-engineering: middleware is minimal (auth, rate-limit, admin check), no abstract base classes, no decorator magic. The complexity is proportional to the problem.

**TypeScript coverage:**
- Full TypeScript across all source files â€” no `any` escape hatches visible in public-facing route handlers
- Shared types in `shared/src/index` create a typed contract between backend and mobile client â€” breaking changes surface at compile time, not runtime
- Prisma-generated types make all DB queries type-safe â€” column name typos are compile errors

**Operational readiness at current scale:**
- pm2 process management with auto-restart â€” zero-downtime handling of uncaught exceptions
- Slack alerting for auth failures and recipe generation errors via `chatAlert()`
- Redis-backed rate limiting with exponential backoff â€” handles Redis instability gracefully
- `/health` endpoint suitable for load balancer or uptime monitoring
- In-memory stats cache with stale fallback â€” public-facing metrics survive DB hiccups

**AI architecture extensibility:**
- `AIProvider` interface + `getAIProvider()` factory â€” adding a fourth AI backend requires implementing one interface and registering the provider key. No other code changes needed.
- Runtime `AI_PROVIDER` env var switching â€” can hot-swap providers without redeployment (after pm2 restart with updated env)
## ASSET:analysis 2026-06-07 16:30 â†’ Production-grade auth stack, typed throughout, multi-provider AI, solid input validation; codebase healthy for current scale

**Tech stack:** Node.js 18+ / TypeScript / Express / Prisma ORM / PostgreSQL / Redis / Ollama (local AI) / JWT + bcrypt / Passport (Local + Google + Apple)

**Strengths:**
- **Full TypeScript** â€” all route handlers typed, shared types in `shared/src/index`, no implicit any visible
- **Multi-provider AI architecture** â€” `getAIProvider()` factory with Ollama/OpenAI/Claude backends, switchable at runtime via env var. Clean `AIProvider` interface in `provider.ts`.
- **Auth is production-ready** â€” bcrypt/12, JWT/7d, rate-limited, Apple JWKS verified, Google OAuth via Passport, email verification token flow, password reset token flow all implemented
- **Prisma ORM** â€” type-safe queries, migrations tracked, cascade deletes configured correctly for most models
- **Role-based access** â€” `requireAdmin` middleware, role-gated rate limits, `isPremium` computed server-side
- **Operational tooling** â€” Slack alerts via `chatAlert()`, structured console logs per request, `/health` endpoint, `process.on` error handlers, Redis retry strategy, in-memory `/stats` cache with TTL
- **API versioning started** â€” 1-1-1 prefix established with explicit comment about legacy deprecation plan

**Scale assessment:**
- Appropriate for current user base on a Mac mini M4. The main bottleneck at scale will be OG image canvas generation (CPU-bound, synchronous) and Prisma connection pool defaults.
- Codebase is ~2,000 lines of TypeScript across 20 files â€” manageable, readable, no premature abstraction.

`useReveal` disconnects the IntersectionObserver after the first intersection (`observer.disconnect()` inside the callback), so elements that have animated in never incur further observer overhead. The FAQ component implements per-question deep linking via `id` attributes and `window.location.hash` comparison — users can share URLs like `/faq#premium` that auto-open and scroll to that specific question. The `scrollMarginTop: 80` on category sections correctly accounts for the fixed navbar height (64px) when category pills trigger smooth scroll.
